# Protein_Localization_Prediction_with_Traditional_Machine_Learning
This project predicts the subcellular localization of proteins based on their amino acid sequences and biochemical traits using traditional machine learning methods and deploys an interactive Streamlit dashboard for predictions. 


# What problem does this project address?
Proteins are functional workhorses of the cell, participating in nearly every biological process. Each protein's function is closely related to where it localizes in the cell, however determining a protein's subcellular location through wet-lab experimentation is costly, time consuming, and often incomplete. This project's aim is to circumvent this process using machine learning to predict protein subcellular localization directly from its amino acid sequence and biochemical properties.
